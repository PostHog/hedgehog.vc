# hedgehog.vc (beta)

hedgehog.vc backs open source businesses and is operated by the team behind [posthog inc](https://posthog.com) (high growth open source yc company)

we believe open source is the future 

we want to help open source startups grow and build better products

## ethos

* **you are open** - you share everything you do publicly
* **we are open** - we share everything we do publicly, and expect feedback on our decisions from anyone on this repo
* **bias for action** - less asking for investor updates, more getting stuck in and helping you when you need it

## focus

we focus on businesses similar to our own - our unique experience is our unfair advantage:

* open source saas start-ups
* seed round stage - we participate but don't lead
* technical founders

you'll probably be a good fit if you're currently going through yc, but we will consider any companies that meet these criteria

we do seed stage because we've had success from seed stage through multiple rounds later ourselves, so can help the most here

## value

* we share our playbook for founding, growing, and operating an open source startup
* we help you solve your hardest problems - our team have lived the hardest parts of growing an open source startup
* we give you funding to help you make your first hires - $50k per startup
* we give you free, unlimited enterprise use of [our tooling](https://posthog.com/product) for building better products for 2 years
* we will intro you to your series a investors - we know everyone who invests in open source

## how

* hedgehog.vc will act as a scout for an existing vc fund
* this means we can focus on helping you build better products, not fund admin 
* we are seeking $500k in capital - raise an issue if we could be a scout for you
