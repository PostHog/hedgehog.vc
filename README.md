# hedgehog.vc (beta)

hedgehog.vc backs open source businesses and is operated by the team behind [posthog inc](https://posthog.com) (high growth open source yc company)

we believe open source is the future 

we want to help open source startups grow and build better products

## ethos

* **you are open** - you share everything you do publicly
* **we are open** - we share everything we do publicly, and expect feedback on our decisions from anyone on this repo
* **bias for action** - less asking for investor updates, more getting stuck in and helping you when you need it

## focus

we focus on businesses similar to our own - our unique experience is our unfair advantage:

* open source saas start-ups
* seed round stage - we participate but don't lead
* technical founders

you'll probably be a good fit if you're currently going through yc, but we will consider any companies that meet these criteria provided you are a US-registered company

we do seed stage because we've had success from seed stage through multiple rounds later ourselves, so can help the most here

## value

* we share our playbook for founding, growing, and operating an open source startup
* we help you solve your hardest problems - our team have lived the hardest parts of growing an open source startup
* we give you funding to help you make your first hires - $100k per startup
* we give you free, unlimited enterprise use of [our tooling](https://posthog.com/product) for building better products for 2 years
* we will intro you to your series a investors - we know everyone who invests in open source

## how

* hedgehog.vc is a scout for an existing vc fund and we have complete decision-making autonomy
* this means we can focus on helping you build better products, not fund admin 
* we have up to $2m in total to invest in 2022 - our standard investment is $100k (but we can be flexible)
* we will ask you for pro rata rights - we want to keep supporting you as you grow

## process

* you send us an intro and tell us a bit about your product and company
* we schedule a zoom call with you if we're interested in learning more
* we send you any follow up questions (kept to an absolute minimum - we'll ask for the round paperwork)
* james and tim - PostHog co-founders - will make a decision in their weekly meeting
  * yes - we ask for your bank details
  * no - we respond with thoughtful feedback
* once we're done, we'll invite you to a shared slack channel 

we're aiming for minimal friction, so please give us feedback
